## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hung Nguyen and I'm currently a junior in Biological Engineering at Wentworth Institute of Technology.

I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my degree, but I hope to combine it with learning Data Science on my own time in order to get my foot into the door with Bioinformatics.
